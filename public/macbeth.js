When shall we three meet again
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
Second Witch
When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.
Third Witch
That will be ere the set of sun.
First Witch
Where the place?
Second Witch
Upon the heath.
Third Witch
There to meet with Macbeth.
First Witch
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Second Witch
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
[Drum]
Third Witch
A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come.
Enter MACBETH and BANQUO
MACBETH
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
BANQUO
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't?
MACBETH
First Witch
Hail!
Second Witch
Speak, if you can: what are you?
Hail!
Hail!
Third Witch
First Witch
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
BANQUO
Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair?
First Witch
Hail!
Second Witch
Hail!
Hail!
Third Witch
First Witch
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
Second Witch
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
Third Witch
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
Second Witch
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
MACBETH
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
Speak, I charge you.
BANQUO
Whither are they vanish'd? 
MACBETH
Your children shall be kings.
BANQUO
You shall be king. Who's here?
ROSS
The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success.
MACBETH
Thanks for your pains.
BANQUO
Cousin, a word, I pray you. MACBETH
This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill, cannot be good.
If chance will have me King, why, chance may crown me Without my stir.
BANQUO
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
MACBETH
Give me your favor: Let us toward the king.
